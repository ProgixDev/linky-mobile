# Tasks 002 — Delivery detail & QR-scan handoff

Ordered, executable, checkboxed. Work top-to-bottom, tick on commit. `[P]` = parallel-safe. Tests precede implementation. **Sequence after spec 001 merges** (shared slice + route — see plan Overlap check).

## Phase 0 — setup

- [x] **T0** Accept [ADR-0009](../../docs/architecture/decisions/0009-expo-camera-qr-scanning.md) (human — accepted 2026-06-23). Branch `feat/002-delivery-handoff` cut off **`feat/driver-app`** (NOT `main` — spec 001 + Linky-auth/backend realignment are unmerged and live only there). `npx expo install expo-camera` → `~56.0.8`; added tailored `ios.infoPlist.NSCameraUsageDescription` + the `expo-camera` plugin in `app.config.ts` (mic + Android `RECORD_AUDIO` disabled — QR only). · done: typecheck green; `expo config` resolves the plugin + usage string.
- [x] **T1** Backend edge function (Deno, service-role, `requireUser` JWT auth). **Only `get-delivery` built** — `livreur-confirm-handoff` ALREADY exists in the canonical backend (`app-mobile/supabase/functions`, see plan backend-reality note). Created `app-mobile/supabase/functions/get-delivery/index.ts` (returns one delivery's FULL address + order + buyer `display_name`, scoped to `livreur_id = caller`; unknown/not-yours → `DELIVERY_NOT_FOUND`; scan_token never returned) modeled on `list-livreur-deliveries`. Registered `[functions.get-delivery] verify_jwt = false` in `config.toml` — matches the canonical post-incident policy (verify_jwt OFF for every fn, auth via in-function `requireUser`), NOT the stale `= true`. · done: modeled + config registered; `deno check` + deploy **deferred** (no Supabase access / import map here). Outside `npm run verify`.

## Phase 1 — core behavior

- [x] **T2** Schema (`model/schema.ts`): `DeliveryDetailWireSchema`/`DeliveryDetailResponseSchema` (get-delivery wire) + flat `DeliveryDetailSchema` (full street address, buyer name, orderId, order ref/amount/snapshot, status); `HandoffResultSchema` (success `{ order_status }`) + `HandoffOutcome` typed union (success/mismatch/already_done/offline/error). · done: typecheck green. (AC-1)
- [x] **T3** QR parse test-first: `__tests__/qr.test.ts` (10 cases) → `lib/qr.ts` `parseOrderQr(raw)` accepts `linky://order/<uuid>/confirm?token=<uuid>` → `{orderId, scanToken}`; rejects junk / non-uuid / other schemes / wrong path / trailing junk / non-string (trust boundary, SEC-INPUT-001). · done: tests green. (AC-5)
- [x] **T4** API test-first: extended `__tests__/deliveries-api.test.ts` (now 15 cases) → `lib/deliveries-api.ts` `getDelivery(id)` (sends `{delivery_id}` only; wire→flat detail; buyer fallback "Customer"; Zod-parse) + `confirmHandoff({orderId, scanToken})` (sends `{order_id, scan_token}` only — no identity, AC-9; via canon `apiPost`, not `functions.invoke`). Maps `INVALID_SCAN_TOKEN`/`NOT_ASSIGNED_LIVREUR`/`ORDER|DELIVERY_NOT_FOUND`→mismatch, `INVALID_STATUS`/`INVALID_DELIVERY_STATUS`→already_done, `NETWORK_ERROR`→offline, else→error — returns a closed `HandoffOutcome` (never throws). · done: tests green. (AC-5/7/8/9)
- [x] **T5** Store: `removeDelivery(id)` in `model/store.ts` + test (delivered item leaves both `items` and `selectActiveDeliveries`). · done: store test green (7 cases). (AC-4)
- [x] **T6 [P]** Scanner UI: `ui/qr-scanner.tsx` — `expo-camera` `CameraView` (`barcodeTypes:['qr']`, `facing:'back'`), `useCameraPermissions` gate that is never a dead end (AC-6): not-asked → "Allow camera" (prompt), permanently denied → "Open Settings" (`Linking.openSettings`), always a Cancel. `lock` ref debounces `onScanned`; component only surfaces the raw string (parsing lives upstream). · done: renders (camera mocked in T8). (AC-2, AC-6)
- [x] **T7** Detail screen: `ui/delivery-detail-screen.tsx` — `useReducer` state machine view→scan→review→confirm→success/error; `getDelivery` on mount (loading/load-error+retry); scanned QR parsed + compared to this delivery's `orderId` before anything (junk/forged/other-order → `mismatch`, nothing released); `confirmHandoff` only on the explicit Confirm tap (the Confirm button unmounts into a `loading` button on tap → debounce; online-only); success → `removeDelivery` + "Delivered — payment released"; offline keeps the token to retry; already-done + error states. Full street address revealed here (vs list area-only). Feature-prefixed testIDs. · done: all states render (verified in T8). (AC-1/3/4/7/8)
- [x] **T8** Component tests: `__tests__/delivery-detail-screen.test.tsx` (11 cases, expo-camera/-router mocked) — detail incl. full street address (AC-1); scan opens scanner (AC-2); valid scan → review, confirm NOT called until tap (AC-3); confirm → success + dropped from store list (AC-4); QR-for-other-order rejected + server-rejected token → mismatch, nothing released (AC-5); permission denied → enable/retry + Settings, no dead end (AC-6); offline → reconnect + retry succeeds (AC-7); already-done message (AC-8); + load-error/retry. · done: green (11/11).
- [x] **T9** Route: replaced placeholder `src/app/delivery/[id].tsx` → reads `id` via `useLocalSearchParams`, renders `<DeliveryDetailScreen id={id} />` (imported through the feature public API per boundaries); exported `DeliveryDetailScreen` from `index.ts`. · done: typecheck green; navigable.

## Phase 2 — verification

- [x] **T10** Maestro `.maestro/flows/handoff-cuj.yaml` — sign-in → open delivery → assert detail + scan affordance (AC-1/2) → deny OS camera prompt → assert in-app permission explainer + cancel (AC-6, no dead end) → back. Live scan/confirm/offline noted as Argent-only (T11). Registered **CUJ-003** in `critical-user-journeys.md` (also satisfies T13's CUJ item; docs:lint CUJ↔Maestro sync green). · done: written; `e2e:ios` **deferred** (no macOS sim + seeded livreur here).
- [ ] **T11** `/verify-ui` on a device — scan a real/dev QR, walk **CUJ-003**, screenshot detail/scan/review/success/mismatch/offline. **DEFERRED — needs a dev build (camera) + device + Supabase.** Must run before merge.
- [x] **T12** `npm run verify` green — format:check + lint + animations:check + typecheck + **test (83 pass / 15 suites)** + docs:lint (CUJ↔Maestro sync OK) + functions:check (driver-app has no `supabase/functions`; `get-delivery` lives in `app-mobile`, outside this gate per T1) + secrets:check. Conventional commits throughout.

## Phase 3 — review & ship

- [x] **T13** `/review` (multi-persona, code-reviewer agent) → verdict REQUEST-CHANGES, **both P1s fixed**: (1) UX — failure phases (offline/mismatch/already_done/error) leaked the "Scan to confirm" primary via a ternary fall-through; bottom action now renders only in `detail` (each failure card owns its action; already_done gained a no-dead-end "Back"); (2) QA/correctness — the plan-claimed Confirm debounce didn't exist: added a synchronous `submitting` ref guard + a double-tap regression test (releases once). Cheap P2s also fixed: stable per-handoff idempotency key threaded to `confirmHandoff` (AC-7 retry replays vs. races the status gate), item-image `accessibilityLabel`, Maestro asserts a row exists before tapping. Server-authority path confirmed sound (no client identity, scan never releases, no scan_token leak from get-delivery). **CUJ-003** registered (in T10). · done: `npm run verify` green (84 tests).
- [x] **T14** `/security-review` (against `docs/security/checklist.md`) → **PASS, no P1s.** SEC-INPUT-001: QR validated pre-network + edge responses Zod-parsed + scanned orderId compared to the opened delivery; server-authority (SEC-LINK-002 / SEC-RLS-001 spirit): identity JWT-derived (`requireUser`), client sends no livreur id, route `id` fetch-only with `get-delivery` scoped to `livreur_id = caller`; money action: release is server-RPC-only, scan never releases (explicit Confirm), online-only, double-tap guarded client + idempotent server + stable idempotency key; SEC-SECRET-001/003: `get-delivery` service-role server-side, **scan_token never returned**, secrets:check green; SEC-STORE-001: full address/buyer name transient only (cache stays area-only). Watch: deploy `get-delivery` with `verify_jwt=false`+`requireUser`; `npm audit` highs are pre-existing.
- [x] **T15** `/feature-report` → [`docs/reports/002-delivery-handoff.md`](../../docs/reports/002-delivery-handoff.md) — diff summary, AC→test traceability (AC-1..AC-9), review/security verdicts, deferred-work list, encode-lesson follow-ups.
- [ ] **T16** Open PR (needs the dedicated `linky-driver` repo; after 001 merges).
- [ ] **T17** After merge: `/update-docs` — feature doc, flip spec → `shipped`.
